# Standard Operating Procedure: Smoke Tests

**Status:** Mandatory  
**Version:** 1.0

## Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the non-negotiable standards for implementing smoke tests. These tests verify that the system is up and running correctly after deployment.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all smoke tests implemented in the `digital-kudos-wall-system-tests` repository.

## Non-Negotiable Standards

### 1. Test Coverage Requirements

Smoke tests MUST:

- Verify core system availability
- Be minimal and focused
- Complete within 2-3 minutes maximum
- Cover only critical paths
- Run before acceptance and E2E tests

Critical paths that MUST be tested:

1. Application startup and health check
2. Main page loading
3. Basic authentication flow
4. Core API endpoints health
5. External system connectivity checks

### 2. Test Implementation

#### Test Structure

```typescript
export class SystemHealthSmokeTest {
  constructor(private readonly healthDriver: HealthCheckDriver, private readonly authDriver: AuthenticationDriver) {}

  async verifySystemHealth(): Promise<void> {
    // Health check
    await this.healthDriver.checkSystemHealth();

    // Auth check
    await this.authDriver.verifyAuthFlow();
  }
}
```

#### Driver Layer Interface

```typescript
export interface HealthCheckDriver {
  checkSystemHealth(): Promise<void>;
  checkDatabaseConnection(): Promise<void>;
  checkExternalServices(): Promise<void>;
}

export interface AuthenticationDriver {
  verifyAuthFlow(): Promise<void>;
  checkLoginPage(): Promise<void>;
  checkRegistrationPage(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 3. Error Handling and Reporting

Error handling MUST:

- Provide clear failure messages
- Include diagnostic information
- Log relevant context
- Support debugging
- Handle timeouts gracefully

Example:

```typescript
export class SmokeTestError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly details: {
      cause: Error;
      diagnostics: DiagnosticInfo;
    }
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "SmokeTestError";
  }
}
```

## Execution Requirements

Smoke tests MUST:

1. Run first in the pipeline
2. Block subsequent test execution on failure
3. Complete within defined timeout
4. Run in all environments
5. Provide immediate feedback

## Review Process

All smoke tests MUST be reviewed for:

1. Minimal and focused scope
2. Quick execution time
3. Critical path coverage
4. Error handling
5. Clear diagnostics
